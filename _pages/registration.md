## Registration is open
 
### Registration Dates:

- Early Registration: September 9–October 21
- Late Registration: October 22– November 11
- Onsite Registration: November 12–16

The ACL & EMNLP Exec have put together the following 3 registration types, each with an option for Authors to register their paper to present at the conference and cover their hard costs of presenting at the conference while allowing non-presenting authors and attendees a discounted rate for future advancement of the NLP Communities the ability to attend. 
 
1. Industrial/Non-Academic
2. Academic 
3. Student

## Authors Registration Fee Details: 

Author Register Paper (for presentation) Industrial/Non-Academic, Academic or Student
 
At least one author of each accepted paper to an ACL conference (ACL, NAACL, EACL, AACL, or EMNLP) must register their paper to present at the conference. 
Exceptions to the statement above:
Accepted Finding that are not being presented. All findings being presented must register their paper.
Workshop shared tasked papers do not need to register their paper to present.
 
### Note all Paper registration fees are based on actual hard cost to the conference. 
In person registration fee reflects the attendees’ hard costs of food & beverage (breaks, welcome reception and social dinner) along with meeting space, av or poster presentation equipment). 
Virtual attendees’ registration fees reflect the virtual costs (internet, AV, content management, platforms). 
 
### Author Deadlines for Registering the Paper to Present: 
To assist the program chairs and committee with publishing the conference details for the program and Anthology we ask all authors to register no later than the following dates:

- Accepted – Main Conference, Findings, CL/TACL, DEMOS & Industry – October 14th 
 
- Accepted – Workshop no later than the Early Registration deadline of October 21st
 
All Authors presenting their paper at a workshop must have 1 author register your paper. If attending the full conference, select the Registered Paper option and follow the prompts  to select  your attendee type.
*Workshop Exception for registering your paper would be shared task papers. Shared Tasks are not required to register your paper.*
Since workshop notifications can come after early registration ends, there will be a way to add a paper to a registration once you receive notification.
 
Paper registration instructions, policy and fees are below the conference rates listed after membership and cancelation policies.
