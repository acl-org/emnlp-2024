The following questions will help you in determining whether and how to apply for a U.S. visa to attend the conference.

### Can I travel to the U.S. without a visa?

Please see [this page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) to determine whether you are eligible to apply for an [Electronic System Travel Authorization (ESTA)](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/) instead, which might be cheaper and easier. This is usually allowed if you hold a passport from a country that participates in the Visa Waiver Program, but there are some exceptions. Be sure to apply for the ESTA at least 72 hours in advance. [Do not](https://visaguide.world/tips/how-to-avoid-esta-fraud/) purchase your ESTA from any website other than the one linked above.

### What kind of visa do I need?

To attend the conference, you should apply for a nonimmigrant B-1 visa. (This also [permits](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/B-1%20permissible%20activities.pdf) you to engage in tourism during your trip.)

### How do I apply for a visa?

Please apply well in advance. Visa applications can take from 1–4 months to be approved and normally require an interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. For details, begin [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) and navigate to the website for the embassy or consulate nearest you for further visa instructions.

### How much will it cost?

The non-refundable visa application fee is [approximately $185](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/fees-visa-services.html#temp) in local currency. Depending on your nationality, you may also have to pay a [visa issuance fee](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country.html).

## Invitation Letters

We are pleased to announce that we have created a [form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=-KBNDTFKdk2s5gpiMx4bhPsn11I1EsNGsk44LIKnyTtUNFE0NlAxRkpSUDhLSk9CME9IT1NNQTJEUC4u) for conference attendees to request an invitation letter for a visa. If you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa, go to the form and follow the instructions. Note that this form is only for those submitting papers to the main conference tracks, as well as invited speakers for and members of the organizing committees for the main conference and co-located workshops. If you are only submitting a paper to a workshop, please reach out to your workshop organizers for an invitation letter. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the local arrangements chairs [Mark Finlayson](mailto:markaf@fiu.edu) and [Zoey Liu](mailto:liu.ying@ufl.edu).

A letter is not specifically required. However, you are supposed to [bring documentation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) to your visa interview. Bringing a letter from the conference organizers can help to establish the purpose of your trip: for example, we can document that you are coming to present a paper.

In addition, if you have already paid for your registration, bringing your receipt can help to establish your ability to pay. In some countries, it may also be wise to bring a letter from your own institution that authorizes you to attend the conference.

## What other documents may be needed in the visa interview?

### The answer to this question varies by the country where the interview is conducted, and perhaps also by your nationality. Typically you will be asked to bring:

- your visa interview appointment letter

- [suitable](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html) photos or digital images

- your passport, valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of stay in the U.S.

- DS-160 application confirmation page

- application fee payment receipt

### You may also bring other documentation that will help you answer the interviewer’s questions. The interviewer is particularly interested to establish:

- The purpose of your trip. See the previous question. You may also be asked to bring your CV.

- Your intent to depart the United States after your trip. You may wish to show your return ticket, and evidence of your work and family responsibilities outside the U.S.

- Your ability to pay all costs of the trip. You may wish to show your bank statement, or evidence of travel grants or sponsorships, etc.

- Your U.S. stay address. You may wish to bring your hotel booking information.

### Is it safe to go ahead and register for the conference before I have a visa?

Yes. If your visa application is denied, you can request a full refund or change your registration from in-person to virtual. Please contact the EMNLP 2024 Registrar at [EMNLPinfo@yesevents.com](mailto:EMNLPinfo@yesevents.com) or toll-free number 1-800-937-8728.
