## Visa/Passport

The following questions will help you in determining whether and how to apply for a U.S. visa to attend the conference.

### Can I travel to the U.S. without a visa?

Please see [this page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) to determine whether you are eligible to apply for an [Electronic System Travel Authorization (ESTA)](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/) instead, which might be cheaper and easier. This is usually allowed if you hold a passport from a country that participates in the Visa Waiver Program, but there are some exceptions. Be sure to apply for the ESTA at least 72 hours in advance. [Do not](https://visaguide.world/tips/how-to-avoid-esta-fraud/) purchase your ESTA from any website other than the one linked above.

### What kind of visa do I need?

To attend the conference, you should apply for a nonimmigrant B-1 visa. (This also [permits](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/B-1%20permissible%20activities.pdf) you to engage in tourism during your trip.)

### How do I apply for a visa?

Please apply well in advance. Visa applications can take from 1–4 months to be approved and normally require an interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. For details, begin [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) and navigate to the website for the embassy or consulate nearest you for further visa instructions.

### How much will it cost?

The non-refundable visa application fee is [approximately $185](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/fees-visa-services.html#temp) in local currency. Depending on your nationality, you may also have to pay a [visa issuance fee](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country.html).

### Invitation Letters

**Update (21st September 2024):** Registration now is open for EMNLP. When you register for the conference, you will receive an automatically generated visa invitation letter. If there are specific details that need to be added or changed in the letter, please reach out to the local arrangements chairs [Mark Finlayson](mailto:markaf@fiu.edu) and [Zoey Liu](mailto:liu.ying@ufl.edu).

A letter is not specifically required. However, you are supposed to [bring documentation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) to your visa interview. Bringing a letter from the conference organizers can help to establish the purpose of your trip: for example, we can document that you are coming to present a paper.

In addition, if you have already paid for your registration, bringing your receipt can help to establish your ability to pay. In some countries, it may also be wise to bring a letter from your own institution that authorizes you to attend the conference.

### What other documents may be needed in the visa interview?

**The answer to this question varies by the country where the interview is conducted, and perhaps also by your nationality. Typically you will be asked to bring:**

- your visa interview appointment letter

- [suitable](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html) photos or digital images

- your passport, valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of stay in the U.S.

- DS-160 application confirmation page

- application fee payment receipt

**You may also bring other documentation that will help you answer the interviewer’s questions. The interviewer is particularly interested to establish:**

- The purpose of your trip. See the previous question. You may also be asked to bring your CV.

- Your intent to depart the United States after your trip. You may wish to show your return ticket, and evidence of your work and family responsibilities outside the U.S.

- Your ability to pay all costs of the trip. You may wish to show your bank statement, or evidence of travel grants or sponsorships, etc.

- Your U.S. stay address. You may wish to bring your hotel booking information.

### Is it safe to go ahead and register for the conference before I have a visa?

Yes. If your visa application is denied, or is delayed past the conference dates, you can request a full refund or change your registration from in-person to virtual. Please contact the EMNLP 2024 Registrar at [EMNLPinfo@yesevents.com](mailto:EMNLPinfo@yesevents.com) or toll-free number 1-800-937-8728.

## Ethics/Harassment

### Code of Ethics Policy 
"ACL adopts the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) in the version adopted June 22nd, 2018, by the ACM Council. In its application to ACL, it is to be read in the contextually appropriate interpretation, e.g., ""ACM member"" is to be read as ""ACL member"". Sec 4.2 should be read as follows:

""4.2 Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACL. Each ACL member should encourage and support adherence by all members of the CL/NLP community regardless of ACL membership. ACL members who recognize a breach of the Code should consider reporting the violation to the ACL, which may result in remedial action."""

"The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of the ACL. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.

It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken."

### Anti-Harassment Policy.
"ACL 2024 adheres to the ACL Anti-Harassment Policy. Any participant who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any current member of the ACL Professional Conduct Committee or Jennifer Rachford, who is usually available at the registration desk of the conference. Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on
any actions taken.

The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of a ACL conference. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference. This includes speech or behavior (including in public presentations and on-line discourse) that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in the conference. We aim for ACL conferences to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to:  harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
